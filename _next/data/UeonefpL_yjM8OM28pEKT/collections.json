The trip to the\njams is somehow mystic for me. It resets my head, gives\nme time to come down from the busyness of the day. I\nobserve the people around me as they scramble towards\ntheir homes or are just starting with their day. Before\narriving, I like walking a bit in the dark, as there is\nalmost not a soul to be seen and then I enter this\nworld where your eyes are no longer the main character\nand your ears start slowly seeing. People laugh and\nexchange their feelings as they try to harmonize sounds\nthey never played before.","cover":"/collections/1/1.jpg"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
