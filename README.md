# Salvoconducto

This is my personal website for photos and random stuff. This is the second version of it.
It's made with next.js, so with react and deployed with github pages. I am working on getting a CMS (Strapi) server ready to be able to upload content with it.

If someone has an interest they can see the code and run it themselves.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To build the static website run

```bash
npm run build
```
